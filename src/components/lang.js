          <p>
            {" "}
            Languages spoken in India belong to several language families, the
            major ones being the Indo-Aryan languages spoken by 78.05% of
            Indians and the Dravidian languages spoken by 19.64% of Indians.
            Languages spoken by the remaining 2.31% of the population belong to
            the Austroasiatic, Sino-Tibetan, Tai-Kadai and a few other minor
            language families and isolates. India has the world's second highest
            number of languages (780), after Papua New Guinea (839). Article 343
            of the Indian constitution stated that the official language of the
            Union is Hindi in Devanagari script instead of the extant English.
            Later, a constitutional amendment, The Official Languages Act, 1963,
            allowed for the continuation of English alongside Hindi in the
            Indian government indefinitely until legislation decides to change
            it. The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the
            Union are "the international form of Indian numerals", which are
            referred to as Arabic numerals in most English-speaking countries.
            Despite the misconceptions, Hindi is not the national language of
            India; the Constitution of India does not give any language the
            status of national language.
